# O'Levels and iGCSE Computer Science Solutions

## Hello!
So this is a repository which will (hopefully) have the python solution to all of the scenario-based questions (2023 onwards).

I will be **only** solving those questions which are based on the revised syllabus: which will include specimen papers and questions from Feb/March 2023 onwards.

The year of each paper, from where question has been taken, will be commented at the very beginning of the code.

You are more than welcome to correct any of my code *or* add your own solutions. 
**HOWEVER, you MUST make a pull request before making any change in this repository.**
